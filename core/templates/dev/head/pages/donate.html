      <h2>Donate to The Oppia Foundation!</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, Sean Lip was a software engineer at Google who missed the
        teaching he used to do while completing his doctorate at the University
        of Cambridge. He saw that the online education tools of the time were
        mostly recorded faces on a screen, missing the feedback and evaluation
        teachers used to work their magic in the classroom. He dreamt of a tool
        that could not only improve the education of students around the world,
        but improve the teaching of educators both online and off. That was
        the beginning of The Oppia Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sean and Stephanie Federwisch started developing Oppia internally at
        Google in June 2012 and launched Oppia.org in 2014. Entirely opensource,
        Oppia has grown to 145,000 users and 5,500 explorations through the
        contributions of 110 people from 20 countries around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oppia.org and its explorations are free to anyone to learn anything.
        In order to continue this while growing and improving the site, The
        Oppia Foundation will gladly accept any donations! These donations
        will be used to fund server costs, marketing, and distribution into
        schools.
